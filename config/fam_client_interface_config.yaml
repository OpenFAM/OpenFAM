#FAM Client Interface Service Config file
# Memory Server Interface used by OpenFAM. default is direct. Other option is rpc.
# memsrv_interface_type value of rpc implies communication between memory server and client interface via rpc.
# memsrv_interface_type value of direct implies communication happens via function calls.

# Metadata Server Interface used by OpenFAM. default is direct. Other option is rpc.
# metadata_interface_type value of rpc implies communication between metadata server and client interface via rpc.
# metadata_interface_type value of direct implies communication happens via function calls.
metadata_interface_type: direct

# Rpc interface
# Rpc address used by Client Interface Service to accept connections from PE.
#
# The PE's connect to this address if the client_interface_type is (defined in fam_pe_config.yaml) is rpc.
#Format:
#rpc_interface: <interface_address>:<portno>
# where interface address is hostname (fqdn)/ip4 address where grpc port should be exposed.
# portno is port to be used by OpenFAM for communication with Client Interface Service.

# List of memory servers.
# Applicable only if memsrv_interface_type is rpc.
#
#Format:
#memsrv_list :
#- <memsrv_id1>:<host_address_1>:<port_no>
#- <memsrv_id2>:<host_address_2>:<port_no>
#- <memsrv_id3>:<host_address_3>:<port_no>
#- <memsrv_id4>:<host_address_4>:<port_no>
# Here memsrv_id is a unique number associated a with memory server.
# And host_address can be hostname (fully qualified domain name)/ipv4 address.

# Example:
# 5:127.0.0.1:8787

# Here metadata_id is a unique number associated a with metadata server.
