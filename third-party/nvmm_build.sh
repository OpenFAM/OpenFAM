# This script assumes you have NOPASSWD access to sudo command
# If it doesnt work, encourage you to copy paste the command and workaround, 
# Or you can edit sudoers file to give NOPASSWD access.
# Works in ubuntu only now, Will add RHEL support "soon"
# The process is considered successful once we have make test passing
