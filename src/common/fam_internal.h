 * comments Modified Dec 13, 2017, by Sharad Singhal to update to OpenFAM-API
 * version 1.01 Modified Feb 20, 2018, by Sharad Singhal to update to
 * OpenFAM-API version 1.02 Modified Feb 23, 2018, by Kim Keeton to update to
 * OpenFAM-API version 1.03 Modified Apr 24, 2018, by Sharad Singhal to update
 * to OpenFAM-API version 1.04 Modified Oct 5, 2018, by Sharad Singhal to
 * include C++ definitions Modifed Oct 22, 2018 by Sharad Singhal to separate
 * out C and C11 definitions
 *
 * Work in progress, UNSTABLE
 * Uses _Generic and 128-bit integer types, tested under gcc 6.3.0. May require
 * “-std=c11” compiler flag if you are using the generic API as documented in
 * OpenFAM-API-v104.
 *
 * Programming conventions used in the API:
 * APIs are defined using underscore separated words. Types start with initial
 * capitals, while names of function calls start with lowercase letters.
 * Variable and parameter names are camelCase with lower case initial letter.
 * All APIs have the prefix "Fam_" or "fam_" depending on whether the name
 * represents a type or a function.
 *
 * Where multiple methods representing same function with different data types
 * in the signature exist, generics are used to map the functions to the same
 * name.
 *
 * Where different types are involved (e.g. in atomics) and the method signature
 * is not sufficient to separate out the function calls, we follow the SHMEM
 * convention of adding _TYPE as a suffix for the C API.
